Salary Prediction Model
 Overview
 This project is focused on building a Machine Learning model that predicts the salary of individuals
 based on features such as education, experience, job role, and more. It leverages data
 preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, training, and evaluation to ensure
 accurate and reliable predictions.
 Dataset- Source: [Your dataset source  e.g., Kaggle or in-house dataset]- Format: CSV- Features:
  - Education Level
  - Years of Experience
  - Job Title
  - Industry
  - Location
  - Current Salary (Target)
 Technologies Used- Python 3.x- Pandas, NumPy- Matplotlib, Seaborn- Scikit-learn- Jupyter Notebook
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 EDA is performed to understand the structure and relationships within the data. It includes:- Handling missing values- Feature distribution analysis- Correlation heatmaps- Outlier detection
 Data Preprocessing- Encoding categorical variables (OneHot or Label Encoding)- Scaling numerical features (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)- Splitting data into training and testing sets
 Model Building
 Multiple models were considered:- Linear Regression- Decision Tree Regressor- Random Forest Regressor- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
 Best-performing model selected based on:- Mean Squared Error (MSE)- R Score
 Training & Testing- Model trained on training set (80%)- Tested on unseen test set (20%)- Cross-validation applied for robust performance
 Results- Best model: Random Forest Regressor (example)- Test Accuracy: R Score: 0.89- Low MSE and RMSE indicate good performance
